    <p>When I tell you I love you, I dont say it out of habit. I say it to remind you that youre the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you for all that you are, all that you have been and all that youre yet to be. And suddenly, all the love songs
        were about you. I love you more than I could ever really say. I wish I could turn back the clock. Id find you sooner and love you longer. I didnt know it was possible to love everything about someone until I met you. Have I mentioned how lucky
        I am to love you? Im so grateful I get to love you. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing Ive done in my life. When you fall in love with someones personality, everything about them becomes beautiful.:</p>
